<h1>Full Stack MEAN Project by slate2b</h1>
<h3>
  PROJECT OVERVIEW
</h3>
<p>
This project is still a work in progress.
</p>
<p>
It started with a static HTML website made with Node.js and Express, working its way to an MVC architecture with MongoDB and a RESTful API.  The most recent updates added an SPA built with Angular for site admins which includes add and edit functionality for data in MongoDB all routed through the RESTful API.  The project will eventually become a dynamic web application with a customer-facing site built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on one side, and then an SPA built with Angular for site admins on the other side, complete with user authentication and access control.

<p>
This Full Stack MEAN application utilizes the following tools, libraries, modules, etc:
  <ul>
    <li>MongoDB</li>							
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>	
    <li>Handlebars (HBS)</li>
    <li>Mongoose</li>
    <li>Seedgoose</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Made using static HTML pages, basic CSS, and images from <a href="http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/">Free Website Templates</a>.</h2>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 1
</h3>
<p>
The first branch of this project started with static HTML pages, basic CSS, and images from <a href="http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com/">Free Website Templates</a> and then implemented a basic website using Node.js and Express.
</p>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 2
</h3>
<p>
The second branch of this project laid the groundwork for an MVC framework and then integrated Handlebars (hbs) partials for the headers and footers which were used for every page.
</p>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 3
</h3>
<p>
The third branch of this project added some additional templating with Handlebars (HBS) as well as working with routes and views to transition from static HTML to dynamic JSON data.
</p>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 4
</h3>
<p>
The fourth branch of this project focused on MongoDB and Mongoose. I created a database in MongoDB and created schema for the travel, meals, and rooms pages.  I used Seedgoose to populate collections for each of those pages with sample data.
</p>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 5
</h3>
<p>
The fifth branch of this project focused on creating a Node.js MongoDB RESTful API with routes and endpoints to access the data in the trips collection in MongoDB.
</p>
<h3>
PROJECT BRANCH 6
</h3>
<p>
The sixth branch of this project created an Angular SPA for admin activities, including adding a new trip and editing existing trips.  The admin SPA is tied to the same MongoDB DB as the customer-facing site through the RESTful API.
